#In Python, every class uses inheritance and is inherited from object by default.
#Hence, the below two definitions of MySubClass are same.

#Definition 1
class MySubClass:   
   pass
#Definition 2
class MySubClass(object):   
    pass                    

#object is known as parent or super class.
#MySubClass is known as child or subclass or derived class.
